# cb-node
A simple nodejs call list application.
My sandbox to play with microservices, MEAN stack, docker and CI/CD.

## Preprequisites
Have docker installed on you local machine.

## Installation
Execute ```docker-compose up``` after cloning this repo.
Out-of-the-box you'll have a running node application connected to a local mongodb that you can use as a dev environment.

## Running
If you can see an ugly HELLO WORLD! message at [localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) , is all ALREADY up and running.

Point your browser at [localhost:8888/api/calls](http://localhost:8888/api/calls) on your host machine and you'll get an empty JSON array.

Right now it expose only this single REST endpoint supporting most-commonly-used HTTP verbs:  GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE... so do some POSTs to seed the DB.

I'll hope you enjoy!
